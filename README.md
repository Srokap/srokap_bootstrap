srokap_bootstrap
=======================

Plugin created as most simplistic usage of [Twitter Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) as a Elgg theme. I'm making it so you could move forward from here. You may want to have a look at [plugin by Dave Tosh](https://github.com/davetosh/twitter_bootstrap)

Assumptions
-----------

* Throw away most of core CSS in favor of bootstrap only
* Change markup a lot
	* not convinced yet about retaining markup too much
* Don't change JavaScripts

TODOs
-----
These are near future priorities to implement:

* Yet to come
